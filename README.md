The Hatchlor is a [cookiecutter] template featuring the modern and extensible Python project manager [hatch] üê£.

With hatch, you no longer need to deal with files like `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or `environment.yml`,
just configure everything in `pyproject.toml`. Thus, hatch is a sophisticated alternative to [pipenv], [poetry], [conda], or
direct [virtualenv] usage. Just think of hatch as a tool that allows you to easily define many isolated development environments,
e.g. virtual but also docker environments, and helps you to manage them. A bit like what [tox] does for testing environments but
for all kinds of environments, e.g. testing, linting your code, buildings your docs, and whatever you want.

Check out a [vanilla Python project] created by the Hatchlor.

## ‚ú® Features

The Hatchlor integrates the following features:

* [hatch]: Python packaging, environment management and test runner,
* [hatch-vcs]: determine the package version automatically from git tags, e.g. `v0.9`,
* [hatch-pip-compile]: support for lock-files,
* [pyproject.toml]: all package, build and tool configuration in one file,
* [pytest]: full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs,
* [coverage]: tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs with pytest integration,
* [GitHub Actions]: workflows with [dependabot], [release-drafter], [labeler], build docs, test & publish to PyPI,
* [ruff]: extremely fast Python linter/formatter, which replaces [isort], [flake8], [black], etc.,
* [mypy]: optional static type checker for Python,
* [mkdocs]: a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator,
* [pre-commit]: pre-commit git hooks that make your life easier,
* [Markdown]: instead of reStructuredText, Markdown is used consistently for all text files,
* [EditorConfig]: maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers,
* [src-layout]: the actual Python package is kept under a `src` folder avoiding many common errors.

As The Hatchlor starts right off with [ruff], there are no legacy settings in pyproject.toml for less complete linting and formatting tools.

The Hatchlor Enhanced integrates additional features:

* [cruft]: assistance for template updates.
* [hatch-vcs-footgun-example]: dynamic version determination for editable install,
* [docsig]: check signatures (script for hatch environment, not yet as pre-commit hook).
* [semantic-release]: local prepare of a commit: create changelog and commit with a version tag,
* [bump-my-version] and [generate-changelog]: alternative to [semantic-release],
* [commitizen]: commit-tool as new alternative to [semantic-release] and combination of [bump-my-version]
and [generate-changelog] with default changelog format improved to be aligned with [semantic-release] changelog format,
* [gitlint]: include linting of commit messages (alternative to commitizen),
* cookiecutter options to switch bewteen [commitizen], [semantic-release] and combination of [bump-my-version] and [generate-changelog] as the toolchain vor versioning and changelog generation,
* [GitHub Actions]: reworked workflows - dump context, add test publishing on TestPy, switch to new PyPi mechanism.
* selection of target platfom and target platform specific GitHub actions.

Regarding support for committing, version management and changelog generation commitizen is right now favorised as it
fits most nicely with the current GitHub workflows.

The amendments support a local development and commit process while "outsourcing" testing for different OS
and with different Python versions to GitHub.
The local development includes local preparation of a changelog.
Commit-messages are linted to enforce commit messages according to conventional commits format as
basis for a proper and automatically generated changelog.

The template includes a `skeleton.py` with a simple function `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci numbers
as demonstration. This is tested with `tests/test_skeleton.py` to demonstrate the corresponding features
from above. As an additional tidbit, `skeleton.py` also features [Typer] to show how `fib` can be
exposed as a CLI command. These files are only for demonstration and can be safely deleted.

## üí´ Quickstart

Install the latest [cookiecutter], i.e. >= 1.4, if not installed:

```console
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Then generate your Python project with:

```console
cookiecutter https://github.com/dornech/the-hatchlor-enhanced.git
```

üéâ That's  it! Now change into the created directory and check out [`README.md`] for more information.

## üôè Credits

To start this project off a lot of inspiration was taken from [hatch], [cookiecutter-pypackage] and [PyScaffold].
